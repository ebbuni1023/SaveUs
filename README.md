## Inspiration
The new COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all of us. However, depending on our position as people and as members of society, the pandemic's influence and effects are felt differently. While some people try to adjust to working online, homeschooling their children, and ordering food through Uber, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. SaveUs, our health tracking app that helps people to manage their symptoms and get advised.

## What it does
SaveUs allows people to track and manage their symptoms if they believe they have exposed to the virus. SaveUs can guide users to the nearest hospitals, clinics,... in their area. SaveUs can help local places to check their customers if they have symptoms or not by scanning QR code, whether they are allowed to enter or need to do temperature screening. 

## How we built it
We utilize all the google-cloud services like google-map-APIs, place-API, firebase... We store user log-in and sign-up information into firebase-auth and allow them to log in to manage their personal symptoms. We use google-map-APIS and JSON data to get the nearby hospitals to place information and display it. We use a real-time database and cloud firestore in order to save user information, contact detail, and their symptoms. 

## Challenges we ran into
Our biggest challenge was finding the local hospital near the user location. Codes were hard to implement but finally, we did it. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This current public health crisis demonstrates that we are all interconnected and that our well-being is contingent on that of others. We are making an app that helps people to be responsible by managing their symptoms and guide them on what to do and where not to go in order not to expose viruses to others.

## What we learned
We learned to manage the project using GitHub, find nearby places using google-place-APIs and authenticate log-in and sign-up users. 

## What's next for SaveUs
We aim to make the app better by adding more features such as making a hardware scanner and providing it to nearby places in order to help to track people more often. We aim to display local hospital information and book appointments online, also, we want to display whether users get vaccinated.
